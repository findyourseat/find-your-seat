# Find Your Seat
This is the official documentation page of Find Your Seat project.

## Who we are
We are [Andrea Napoletani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-napoletani-aa0b87166/), [Alessandro Giannetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-giannetti-2b1864b4/) and [Stefano Milani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-milani-561044181/) three students at "La Sapienza" University of Rome.

## The Project
This project aims to build a system that allows you to know the situation of the seats on the regional train in real-time. It also allows to choose a seat according to the temperature of the wagons.

We use Force sensor to recognize if a seat is available or not, it sends messages to the network through LoRa technology and visualize the result in the Android/Ios application.

For more detailed information see our [Hackster blog post](https://www.hackster.io/andreanapoletani/find-your-seat-on-the-regional-train-using-your-app-525f37)

### Project overview
The project is divides in two main parts:
* the first part includes all the technical details used to implement the system. Starting from the hardware used on the train (to recognize if a seat is free or not) to the software services used to manage messages from the sensors;
* the second part includes the details for the implementation of the application, both for Android and IOS, developed to allow the user to use the system.

## How to use
To use this code you need to make some preliminaries steps.

First follow the steps to configure The Things Network application and device on our [Hackster blog post](https://www.hackster.io/andreanapoletani/find-your-seat-on-the-regional-train-using-your-app-525f37) (Section 2.1).

Then in each folder, mobile_app and mbed_sketch, we explain separately the steps that you need to make.
